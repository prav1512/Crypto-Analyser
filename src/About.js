     <h2>What is bitcoin</h2>
     <p>Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a digital asset that uses
         cryptography to control its creation and management rather than relying on cen
         tral authorities.[1] Originally designed as a medium of exchange, Bitcoin is now primarily regarded as
          a store of value. The history of bitcoin started with its invention and implementation by Satoshi Nakamoto, who integrated
           many existing ideas from the cryptography community. Over the course of bitcoin's history, it has undergone rapid growth 
           to become a significant store of value both 
        on- and offline. From the mid-2010s, some businesses began accepting bitcoin in addition to traditional currencies</p>

           <h2>Martti Malmi</h2>

           <p>Martti Malmi, a Finnish programmer, played a crucial role in the early days of Bitcoi
            n. He worked closely with Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, helping to 
            improve its code and build its infrastructure. Malmi even set up one of the
             first places where people could trade Bitcoin, called Bitcoin Market.
While Malmi eventually moved on to other pro
jects (currently developing a NOSTR client called iris.to), his early c
ontributions were vital in shaping Bitcoin into what it is today. His story hig
hlights the collaborative effort behind Bitcoinâ€™s success and its journey from an experi
mental idea to a global phenomenon.</p>
